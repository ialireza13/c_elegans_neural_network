# Symmetries and Synchronization from Whole-Neural Activity in *C. elegans* Connectome

This repository accompanies the paper **"Symmetries and synchronization from whole-neural activity in *C. elegans* connectome: Integration of functional and structural networks."** It contains the Python code and analysis scripts used to explore the relationship between network symmetries and synchronization in the nervous system of *C. elegans*.

## Abstract

Understanding the dynamical behavior of complex systems from their underlying network architectures is a long-standing question in complexity theory. Many metrics, such as motifs, centrality, and modularity, have been used to characterize network features. Network symmetries, however, hold particular importance due to their role in underpinning the synchronization of system unitsâ€”a common feature in nervous system activity patterns.

In this study, we present a principled method for inferring network symmetries by integrating functional neuronal activity data with structural connectome information. Using nervous system-wide population activity recordings of the *C. elegans* backward locomotor system, we identify and analyze fibration symmetries in the connectome. These structures provide insights into neuron groups that synchronize their activity and reveal functional building blocks in the motor periphery.

This repository contains the code used to analyze these symmetries, offering a computational framework to investigate structure-function relationships in biological networks. Our approach provides a foundation for further studies in complex systems, including the nervous systems of larger organisms.
